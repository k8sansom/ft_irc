ft_irc:

You have to develop an IRC server in C++ 98.

You mustn’t develop a client.

You mustn’t handle server-to-server communication.

Your executable will be run as follows:
./ircserv <port> <password>
	/*these will be private attributes in our server class*/
• port: The port number on which your IRC server will be listening to for incoming
IRC connections.
	/*If you bind your program to port 0, the operating system will automatically bind it to any 		available port within the range of Dynamic or private ports (49152 to 65535). This can be useful when the specific port number is not important.*/
• password: The connection password. It will be needed by any IRC client that tries
to connect to your server.

III.1 Requirements
• The server must be capable of handling multiple clients at the same time and never
hang.
	/*channels:
		https://modern.ircdocs.horse/#channels*/
• Forking is not allowed. All I/O operations must be non-blocking.
• Only 1 poll() (or equivalent) can be used for handling all these operations (read,
write, but also listen, and so forth).
	Because you have to use non-blocking file descriptors, it is
	possible to use read/recv or write/send functions with no poll()
	(or equivalent), and your server wouldn’t be blocking.
	But it would consume more system resources.
	Thus, if you try to read/recv or write/send in any file descriptor
	without using poll() (or equivalent), your grade will be 0.
• Several IRC clients exist. You have to choose one of them as a reference. Your
reference client will be used during the evaluation process.
	/*https://weechat.org/*/
• Your reference client must be able to connect to your server without encountering
any error.
• Communication between client and server has to be done via TCP/IP (v4 or v6).
	/*somewhere here we would have to check the length of the TCP/IP address and fill in any differences with zeros*/
• Using your reference client with your server must be similar to using it with any
official IRC server. However, you only have to implement the following features:
	◦ You must be able to authenticate, set a nickname, a username, join a channel,
	send and receive private messages using your reference client.
	◦ All the messages sent from one client to a channel have to be forwarded to
	every other client that joined the channel.
	◦ You must have operators and regular users.
	◦ Then, you have to implement the commands that are specific to channel
	operators:
		∗ KICK - Eject a client from the channel
		∗ INVITE - Invite a client to a channel
		∗ TOPIC - Change or view the channel topic
		∗ MODE - Change the channel’s mode:
			· i: Set/remove Invite-only channel
			· t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel
			operators
			· k: Set/remove the channel key (password)
			· o: Give/take channel operator privilege
			· l: Set/remove the user limit to channel
• Of course, you are expected to write a clean code.
